# Flexbox Code Repository

This code is meant to be run by git cloning in the home directory of a Raspbian image on a raspberry pi. Follow the instructions in each README within each folder to ensure that all setup has been configured properly.

Some of the included scripts send and receive data from a centralized server. The domain in these scripts is currently at 'yourserverdomain.com', and will need to be replaced with your actual server domain during implementation.
